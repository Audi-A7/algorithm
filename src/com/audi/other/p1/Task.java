/**
 * 1. Problem One
 * <p>
 * If there are multiple tasks, the order in which they are executed has a directed acyclic (DAG) dependency as shown below (just an example),
 * e.g the execution of task A cannot begin until task C and task G are all completed.
 * <p>
 * Define task class and its execution method, and design a program, When any number of tasks with this DAG relationship are input,
 * the program outputs the order in which they are executed.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * Test input: Task A, Task B, Task C, Task D, Task E, Task F, Task G, Task H
 * <p>
 * Test output: Task H, Task B, Task G, Task C, Task E, Task A, Task D, Task F
