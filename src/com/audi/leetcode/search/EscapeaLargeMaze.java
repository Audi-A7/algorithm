 * <p>
 * <p>
 * In a 1 million by 1 million grid, the coordinates of each grid square are (x, y) with 0 <= x, y < 10^6.
 * <p>
 * We start at the source square and want to reach the target square.  Each move, we can walk to a 4-directionally adjacent square in the grid that isn't in the given list of blocked squares.
 * <p>
 * Return true if and only if it is possible to reach the target square through a sequence of moves.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * 这题和https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/类似  但是这题的搜索数量级要大一些
